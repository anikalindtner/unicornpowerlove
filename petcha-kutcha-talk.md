This is Nina, she studied slavic languages and political science,  attended a rails girls beginner workshop in february this year. In july she quit her job in marketing to program and work on the open source project spree.

Hi, I'm Anika from Berlin and I'm going to tell you about a true story. The story of Rails girls summer of code.

###Me

Just one and a half years ago i co-founded Rails Girls Berlin and this is where it all began for me. The whole crazy, lovely story.
Since then, i studied gender studies, i worked as a teacher,  in an social media agency, and  - in june i joined the **travis CI** team as a community manager.

###Travis CI

Travis not only has one of the cutest maskots i've ever seen, WHICH also resembles one of their founders, Sven Fuchs quite a lot, but they also are doing some amazing work. They are running tests for your code and deploy it for you, so you don't have to worry about that.
Travis has always been rooted and been born in the Open Source community and they aupported  Rails Girls form the first minute, which is one of the reasons I love them. Sven Fuchs and Konstantin Haase for example ave coached, mentored on many events and been especially involved with Rails Girls Berlin. 

###Rails Girls Berlin
We in Berlin were the first local chapter of Rails Girls and we started it, because we fell in love with programming and wanted to continue doing that. Together. So over the time we started follow up Workshops and helped organize weekly project groups. Our goal was: To bring people together to keep on coding. So that they don't have to sit at home alone with only their computer and at one point want to throw it at the wall - in a group you have people stopping you from doing that ;)

###Rails Girls Summer of Code
To think about further steps we could do to help these women getting even deeper into code, we had a meeting with coaches and organizers in [April] this year. There - with coffee and cake - the idea of a Rails Girls Summer of Code was born. 

####The idea
The idea was to get Rails Girls students into Open Source. They would be paid so that they're free to work on Open Source projects for 3 months. Fulltime. The concept was to always have two students pair, because two is always better then one. (you motivate each other and learn so much better).These teams would choose different open source projects, find a coach and a mentor to support them.
We wanted to start contributing to the Open Source community and work together towards more diverstiy in tech.

####The story
After Sven Fuchs gave a lighning talk about this idea at a workshop in May, a whole team formed, who wanted to make this happen and the work started.
But to make the dream come true we not only needed help but money. A lot. So we spread the word, and talked to many peole rooted in the communtiy. We had the goal (an ambitious one) to supportbe 10 students, that would be 5 teams - 50.000 dollars.

We started the crowdfunding campaign and after 2 weeks we got this:
80.000 dollars. 
This is a huge amount of money, which not only could buy you tons and tons of cheesecake, but which could support 19 students - so 9 more then we'd hoped for.
On board for sponoring came wonderful community heros believing in our idea. Heros like github, google open source, 37signals, tilde, soundcloud and of course travis CI , who kickstarted this project and is the main organizer and supporter. ...They took me on board not only to be their communtiy manager, but to take over for Sven, who then could go back to his actual job - programming.

Okay,so the talk in may, the crowdfunding campaing running in June and the program officially started in 1st of July.
And not only the sponsored teams started to get going, but we also have 15 volunteering students, who wanted to code over the summer no-matter-what. SO INSPIRING!

(This was how we got from a dream to 19 sponsored scholarships in only under 2 months!)
A lot of people are putting all their free time in this project, helped to create everything from a website to a whole support net of coaches.
I believe we have around 109 people working on in and with this project. they are students, coaches, mentors, helpers, deveopers, organizers and friends.

In July we started with our summer and since then the story has become even more fantastic. The students are working on projects like hackety hack, species, sinatra, bundler,disapora, rubinius,or a job board for open source. To only name a few!
I could talk about the teams and introduce them to you for days, but unfortunately I only have 4 more minutes to talk - so just visit our website and get to know them there. Follow their summer, their code, their i-need-chocolate-now-moments as well as the happy dance moments. 
They are writing open source stories here and you can follow the process of how the scene changes day by day a bit.

Amazingly we also got 59 free tickets to over 16 different conferences all over the world (THANKS BUBBLECONF).
So the students are now actually travelling to conferences and just like me standing on stage, a bit scared but also with a big dream and a fantastic summer story to tell.

###The students
The women I'm telling you about are from the most different places and backgrounds. 
We have people from Columbia, the US, Poland, India, Czech Republic ... and they all have different backgrounds - they are freelance movie directors,  , pr-interns, studies photographers, study Human-Computer Interaction and French philology. The all have one goal: contribute to open source and code full-time.

###True story.

 Now we actually have a full grown project that takes the Rails Girls movement to another level. It's a yearly chance for people who fell in love with code and continued learning to really get deeper into code, to do nothing BUT code full-time. It's a serious step towards more diversity in tech.
This all was made possible by people who believed in the cause, in the change and it all started only 4 months(!) ago with coffee, cake and and idea.

I'm still truly amazed by this crazy, wonder wonderful journey! It's brilliant to see each day, how new things are being created and how the scene starts to change by tiny but determined steps. 
I only realised when preparing this talk, and chatting with my friends and family about this, just WHAT an unusal thinge we've build here, what we achieved over this summer. 

It seems that if you really put your whole heart into something - the whole heart with all bits and pieces - you can manage unbelievable things.
And I'm so happy to be part of this dream. Everybody in here can be! It's been a huge step for the community and even bigger steps for these women that started to chang their lifes. And the most amazing this is - this is only one of more and more amazing initiatives, courses and stories. THIS is only the beginning! Thanks.
