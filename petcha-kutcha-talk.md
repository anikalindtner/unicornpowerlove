Hi, I'm Anika from Berlin and I'm going to tell you about a true story. The story of Rails girls summer of code.
[SLIDE 2]

###Me

Just one and a half years ago i co-founded Rails Girls Berlin and this is where it all began for me. The whole crazy story.
Since then, i studied gender studies, worked as a teacher, in a social media agency, and  - in june i joined the **travis CI** team as a community manager.

###Travis CI

Travis not only has one of the cutest maskots [SLIDE 3] i've ever seen, WHICH kinda resembles one of their founders, Sven Fuchs quite a lot, but they  are also doing amazing work. They are running tests for your code and deploy it, so you don't have to worry about that.
One of the reasons, I love them, is that Travis has always been rooted in the Open Source community and that they supported Rails Girls form the first minute. [SLIDE 4] Sven Fuchs and Konstantin Haase for example have coached and mentored on many events and been especially involved with Rails Girls Berlin. 

###Rails Girls Berlin
We in Berlin were the first local chapter of Rails Girls and we started it, because we fell in love with programming and wanted to continue doing that.Together. So over the time we started follow up Workshops [SLIDE 5] and helped organize weekly project groups. Our goal was: To bring people together who wanted to keep on coding. So that they don't have to sit at ho me alone with only their computer and at one point want to throw it at the wall - in a group you have people stopping you from doing that ;)

###Rails Girls Summer of Code
To think about further steps we could do to help these women[SLIDE 6] getting even deeper into code, we had a meeting with coaches and organizers in [April] this year. There - with coffee and cake - the idea of a Rails Girls Summer of Code was born.

####The idea
The idea was to get Rails Girls students into Open Source. They would be paid so that they're free to work projects. Open Source. 3 months. Fulltime. [SLIDE 7] The concept was to always have two students pair up, because two is always better then one. (you motivate each other and learn so much better - and can share your chocolate).These teams would choose different open source projects, find a coach and a mentor to support them. 
We wanted to start contributing to the Open Source community and work together towards more diverstiy in tech.[SLIDE 8]

####The story
After Sven Fuchs gave a lighning talk about this idea, a whole organizing team formed.
But to make the dream come true we needed money. A lot. So we spread the word, and talked to many peole rooted in the communtiy. We had the goal to supportb 10 students, that would be 5 teams - 50.000 dollars.

We started the crowdfunding campaign and after 2 weeks we got this:[SLIDE10]
80.000 dollars. 
This is a huge amount of money, which not only could buy you tons and tons of cheesecake, but which could support 19 students - so 9 more then we'd hoped for. 
On board for sponoring we have wonderful community heros believing in our idea. Heros like github, google open source, 37signals, tilde,[SLIDE11] soundcloud and of course travis CI , who kickstarted this project and is the main organizer and supporter. ...They took *me* on board not only to be their communtiy manager, but to take over for Sven, who then could go back to his actual job - programming.

####The teams
Okay,so the talk in may, the crowdfunding campaing running in June and the program officially started 1st of July.[SLIDE12]
And not only the sponsored teams started to get going, but we also have 15 volunteering students, who wanted to code over the summer no-matter-what. SO INSPIRING!

A lot of people are putting a lot of free time in this project, coach, mentor, tweet, blog, helped to create everything from a website, to a whole support net of coaches.[SLIDE13]
We have amazing people  working on in and with this project. 

####The projects
In July we started with our summer and since then the story has become even more fantastic. The students are working on projects like hackety hack, rails, sinatra, bundler, a database of endangered species of the world. To only name a few!
I could talk about the teams and introduce them to you for days[SLIDE14], but unfortunately I only have 2 more minutes to talk - so you can visit our website and get to know them there. Follow their summer, their code, their i-need-chocolate-now-moments as well as the happy dance moments. 

(Amazingly we also got 59 free tickets to over 16 different conferences all over the world (THANKS BUBBLECONF).
So the students are now actually travelling to conferences and just like me standing on stage, a bit scared but also with a big dream and a fantastic summer story to tell.)

####The students
The women I'm telling you about are from the most different places and backgrounds. 
We have people from Columbia,[SLIDE15] the US, Poland, India, Czech Republic, the Netherlands ... and they all have different backgrounds - they are freelance movie directors, photographers, study Human-Computer Interaction and French philology but they all have one goal: contribute to open source and code full-time.

####True story.

 Now we actually have a full grown project [SLIDE16] that takes the Rails Girls movement to the next level.
 Now you not only can start loving programming at a workshop, but also keep on coding towards a goal. 
 It's a yearly opportunity for beginners who really want more.  They can start learning and preparing for the program next year. And it's not only an important learner's goal and opportunity [SLIDE17] to have a wonderful summer and to change your life but it's a serious step towards more diversity in tech.

This all was made possible by people who believed in the cause, in the change and it all started only 4 months(!) ago with coffee, cake and and idea.

I'm still truly amazed by this adventure! It's brilliant to see each day[SLIDE18], how new things are being created and how the scene starts to change by tiny but determined steps. 
I only realised really when preparing this, and talking with friends & family, just WHAT an unusal thinge we've build here.

It seems that if you really put your whole heart into something - the whole heart with all bits and pieces  - you can manage unbelievable things.[SLIDE19]
And I'm so happy to be part of this dream. Everybody in here can be! It's been a huge step for the community and even bigger steps for these women. This summer is barely over and it's already time to prepare the next one.We always are happy about people joining us who want to take part/coach/support/ us or just send cat gifs.[SLIDE20] If you want to be part of this amazing thing, just get in touch. Wonderfully enougj, this is only one many initiatives, events and stories coming up in tech. And there are many more to come.
THIS was only the beginning![transition 14 sec]Thanks.
